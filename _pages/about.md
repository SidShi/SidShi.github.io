I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Scalable Solvers Group of the Applied Mathematics and Computational Research Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Sherry Li](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/applied-mathematics-dept/scalable-solvers/members/staff-members/xiaoye-li/). My general research interests lie in Numerical Linear Algebra, Scientific Computing, and High Performance Computing. I am particularly interested in tensor formats and decompositions.

Before LBNL, I obtained my Ph.D. in the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Alex Townsend](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~ajt/). My thesis is [Tensor decompositions with dimensionality manipulations](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2680264330?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses).
